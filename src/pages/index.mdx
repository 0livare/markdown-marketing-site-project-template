# 🧑‍🚀 Hello, Astronaut!

Welcome to the official blog starter template. This
template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
`astro.config.mjs` file. You can customize your setup with
React, or Vue to your project.

Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:

- Edit this page in `src/pages/index.astro`
- Edit the site header items in `src/components/Header.astro`
- Add your name to the footer in `src/components/Footer.astro`
- Check out the included blog posts in `src/pages/blog/`
- Customize the blog post page layout in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`
