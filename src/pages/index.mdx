# Hello, Ryan! ðŸ‘‹

I hope you find this project useful!

It's an [Astro.js][astro] project. Astro has its own file extension `.astro` which is a file that can combine HTML, CSS, and JS into a single file. The JS goes in the top section that starts and ends with three dashes `---`. The CSS can go in a `<style>` tag below the JS section at the root of the file. Any html element can also go at the root of the file, including a root `<html>` tag.

For styling I've installed [Tailwind CSS][tailwind] which uses a bunch of CSS utility classes to style stuff. It's a bit of a controversial solution in the web community, but I really like it because it make styling things faster. For the most part it has has one utility class per CSS property, so it's pretty easy to learn.

I've also installed [tailwind-typography] so that you don't have to think about styling the typography, it should just work.

Astro is built for content, which is why I suggested it for you. It supports MDX out of the box, which is Markdown that can also have components used in it. [Here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#usage) is more information about how to use MDX in Astro.

It supports MDX files directly inside of `pages/`. All files inside of `pages/` create pages in the application, using file based routing.

Astro also supports collections of content inside the `content/` directory, which might not make sense for your use case. I left it there though so you could see it in case it was useful.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
`astro.config.mjs` file. You can customize your setup with
React to your project.

React components can also be integrated hand in hand with Astro components if that becomes useful for you, but I haven't added that yet. [Here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react) are instructions on how you could add React to this project.
